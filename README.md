The Tourism Management System is a dynamic web-based application designed to streamline and enhance the management of tourism activities through the integration of PHP and SQL technologies. This system offers a comprehensive solution for handling various aspects of tourism operations, including user management, destination management, booking processes, and review functionalities. Built with PHP for server-side scripting and SQL for robust database management, the system facilitates seamless interaction between users and the backend infrastructure.

Tourists can browse and search for destinations, make reservations, and provide feedback through a user-friendly interface, while administrators have the capability to oversee and manage bookings, update destination information, and handle user accounts efficiently. The systemâ€™s use of SQL ensures reliable data storage and retrieval, enabling smooth operations and accurate reporting. By leveraging PHP and SQL, the Tourism Management System not only simplifies administrative tasks but also enhances the overall experience for both tourists and operators, making it a valuable tool for modern tourism management.
